Highlights
• A coupled GIS and distributed hydrologic modeling framework, PIHMgis was developed.
• PIHMgis uses national geospatial dataset to setup, execute, and analyze simulations.
• Procedural framework improves model-data integration using shared geodata model.


PIHMgis is an open-source, platform independent, tightly coupled GIS and distributed hydrologic modeling framework, PIHMgis (www.pihm.psu.edu). PIHMgis improves model-data integration, and provides functionalities for watershed delineation, domain decomposition, parameter assignment, simulation, visualization and analyses.
